                Galen Crew is an American recording artist, producer, and songwriter from Nashville, Tennessee. His
                music is known for
                its dream-like quality which often features deep yet whimsical themes and seems to emanate from a
                different world. At
                his core, Galen is a storyteller. He crafts stories that pull from various art forms….citing fantasy
                authors such as
                Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Herman Hesse as having inspired him just as much as the Beatles, Coldplay, and
                John Mayer.
                Imagine if the mysterious Grimm Brothers fairy tale collections were somehow transformed into modern pop
                songs – and
                you’ll start to get idea of the imagery, depth, and layers within Galen’s music.

                Having played in various bands throughout his life, Galen had always been primarily the songwriter and
                guitarist. But at
                age 19, he began writing unique material that didn’t fit with any of the bands he was playing with, and
                he tentatively
                stepped out as a vocalist himself. The first few demos he recorded as a solo artist immediately caught
                the attention of
                Roger Cook, legendary British songwriter (“I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing”; “Long Cool Woman in a
                Black Dress”).
                Galen and Roger have now written over 100 songs together. One of them, titled “Sleepyhead” – a unique
                story song that is
                something of a medieval myth or fairy tale – organically went viral in China. Upon discovering that his
                music was
                gaining millions upon millions of streams on Chinese music platforms, Galen toured the country twice –
                and found that
                although he had never been to Asia before, his fans knew the words to his songs in every city he
                performed in. Galen
                describes the experience as being simultaneously surreal and inspiring. In fall 2016 he teamed up with
                Hover Coalition
                Music.
